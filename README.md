# Trusted Pods

Trusted Pods is a decentralized compute marketplace where developers can run container pods securely and confidentially through small and medium cloud providers. It is tailored towards providing a one-stop service for finding infrastructure to run pods in a cost efficient, serverless manner.

## Building

To build the Go projects in `./cmd/`, use the following command:

```bash
go build -o bin ./cmd/*/
```

Alternatively, you can run them directly with:

```bash
go run ./cmd/trustedpods/ #...
```
